# octivated
Let's be honest! `a:active` never works properly. And it's always a headache to manually pass .active class from backend to frontend. So, this small piece of plugin/extension whatever you wanna call it adds .active class to the current path and now you can only style the .active class. If you're using Bootstrap then it's already styled.

## How to use?
1. Download the repository or clone
2. Put `octivated.js` anywhere in your project. (Preferably in: `js/octivated.js`)
3. Now just include the file with Script tag: `<script src="js/octivated.js"></script>`

**Done!**

# octivated
What **Octivated** does is adds `active` class to the current link you're at.

## How to use?
1. Download the repository or clone
2. Put `octivated.js` anywhere in your project. (Preferably in: `js/octivated.js`)
3. Now just include the file with Script tag: `<script src="js/octivated.js"></script>` > You must put the script at the end of `</body>` tag. Placing it in `<head></head>` tag will not work

Or use jsDeliver CDN: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/obuxim/octivated/octivated.js"></script>`

**Done!**
